Javascript Light weight FPS based Tween Engine 

I am a developer, working in the advertising world for a pretty long time.
Once Flash conquered interactive web, TweenLite was the most famous tool for animation and it was so light so it can be used even for 30kb or 50kb banners.

But after Javascript version TweenLite & TweenMax was developed, the designer & developed was so happy that they donâ€™t need to learn new syntax again, but the convenience has the price.

Minified TweenLite is 22k, and it needs 5k easing pack to add nice movement.
TweenMax is 108k, some CSS plug-ins are near 40k.
Gzip helps a bit when directly download it form the URL, but it adds some HTTP calls then.

My dear friend Ian developed a CSS transition base animation engine, which is 6k, but the syntax is far from TweenLite that designer so familiar with, and many features are also missing, like onUpdate, because it is based on CSS transition, some of the API tools are not easy to be added.

That is why I am trying to come up with this solution. Tweensi.
